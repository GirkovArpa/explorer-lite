## What is this?

It's a file explorer restricted to certain folders and file types.  It's basically a clone of [this](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-js-sdk/tree/main/samples.sciter/sys) official example with a few tiny modifications.

Currently, the file types allowed are `rtf`, `pdf`, `lnk`, and `url`.

## But why though?

It was requested [here](https://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=50804.0).

## How to use it?

Create a folder named `data` in this folder, and put some files matching the above criteria inside it.

Then, run [`scapp.exe`](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-js-sdk/blob/main/bin/windows/x64/scapp.exe) in this folder.
